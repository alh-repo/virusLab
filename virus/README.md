This virus will infect any python script found in the current directory.

To test, copy all the files except test.py into a subfolder "virusLab":
	run calc.py to show that it is clean
	run virus.py to infect the current directory files
	run calc.py again to show that it was "infected"
	
	now copy and paste test.py into subfolder virusLab
	run test.py to show that it is clean
	run calc.py this time to infect the directory files
	run test.py again to show that it was "infected"
